<div align="center"><h2>✨ What is Stremio Kai?</h2></div>

The heart of Stremio Kai — a refined fork of Stremio Community Edition — is its focus on stunning clarity, smart automation, and smooth motion even on modest hardware. For standard content, it behaves exactly like Community Edition, but adds intelligent automation and *optional* anime‑specific playback profiles when they’re relevant. The “Kai” suffix reflects its purpose: a remastered take on Community Edition, enhancing the engine, UI, and automation for a premium experience.

Why bother with manual adjustments? Stremio Kai handles them for you — detecting content type, applying optimal playback settings, choosing the right subtitles, and even skipping intros and outros Netflix‑style, letting you simply relax and watch.

This blend of automation and precision tuning transforms the project from a configuration into a fully intelligent system. Every component was purpose‑built or carefully refined to eliminate real‑world annoyances and deliver a consistently exceptional viewing experience.
